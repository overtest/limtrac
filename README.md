# ‚ö° Limtrac

**LimTrac** is a simple program written in Rust, designed for GNU/Linux-based operation systems, which enforces process security policies (using such GNU/Linux capabilities as `seccomp`, `prlimit`, `cgroups`, etc) to the current running process and executes a requested program with specified arguments as the specified user.

### ‚ú® Features

`Limtrac` is a part of [Overtest](https://github.com/overtest) free software project, and is being used by Overtest Verification Agent (also known as `overtest-agent`) for untrusted programs execution, so it contains only features, needed by `overtest-agent` in GNU/Linux environment. For now, the quickest way to determine available features list is to browse the source code of the program.

**WARNING:** As it said before, `limtrac` is only a third-party dependency for Overtest, so its features depend on the main project needs. Feel free to use `limtrac` source code base to create your own apps - it is the safest way to use its features.

### üèó Building

You can only build `limtrac` in GNU/Linux environment (Windows Subsystem for Linux is also supported üòâ). To build an executable, use standard Cargo build command:

- **Debug:** `cargo build`

- **Release:** `cargo build --release`

**Tip:** Use [JetBrains CLion](https://jetbrains.com/clion/) with official Rust plugin & WSL 2 to build `limtrac` üòÉ!

### ‚öô Executing

[Overtest](https://github.com/overtest/overtest) executes `limtrac` using [CliWrap](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/CliWrap) (a library for cross-platform .NET applications) with I/O streams piping and setting these environment variables:

```bash
# ###################################
# # Required environment variables: #
# ###################################

# A string containing a full path to the executable.
LIMTRAC_FULLPATH = "/usr/bin/example_program"

# A string containing arguments list. Always must contain
# a minimum of one argument. First passed argument must
# be a name of the program.
LIMTRAC_ARGUMENTS = "example_program first_argument second_argument"

# A string which represents a "run as another user" feature.
# If set to empty string, "run as" feature will be disabled.
LIMTRAC_RUNAS = "testuser"

# ######################################
# # Unnecessary environment variables: #
# ######################################

# Enable or disable process resource limiting features,
# see https://linux.die.net/man/2/setrlimit for docs
DEFAULT_RLIM_ENABLED = "true"
LIMTRAC_RLIM_CORE = "0"
LIMTRAC_RLIM_NPROC = "1"
LIMTRAC_RLIM_NOFILE = "10"

# Disallow dangerous system calls usage (see sources)
LIMTRAC_SCMP_ENABLED = "true"
# Disallow move, remove and symlinks operations on file system
LIMTRAC_SCMP_FS_GUARD = "true" # coming soon
```

Also, when executing `limtrac`, you must set a working directory yourself. `Limtrac` not depends on any other files than a single executable and some system-wide shared libraries, so working directory can be safely set to specified in `LIMTRAC_FULLPATH` environment variable program's working directory.

Before using `limtrac`, don't forget to add executable modificator to it:

```bash
chmod +x ./limtrac
```
