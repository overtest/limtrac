# :closed_lock_with_key: Security Policy

**The author of Overtest and project's community take security bugs seriously.** We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## :heart: Supported versions

Security updates will typically only be applied to the latest release and current `git` branches (at least until Overtest reaches the first stable major version).

## :warning: Reporting a vulnerability

To report a security issue, email [contact@sirkadirov.com](mailto:contact@sirkadirov.com?subject=OVERTEST_SECURITY)
and include "`OVERTEST_SECURITY`" in the subject line.

Maintainers will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Note also that we can use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories) to disclose, fix, and publish information about the vulnerability you responsibly reported to us. You can find Overtest security advisories published [here](https://github.com/overtest/limtrac/security/advisories?state=published).
